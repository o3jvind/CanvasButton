# cCanvasButton

cCanvasButton is a custom control for XOJO and as the name implies a button based on a Canvas Control.
The button can function as a "Push Button", "Toggle Button" and "Sticky Button" and has six different modes - namely:

Normal
Hover
Down
Toggled
Hover Toggled
Down Toggled.

Yes, in fact it has 12 different modes because all 6 modes can be individually configured to "Dark Mode".

The button supports alpha and thus you can use images with alpha channels. Both as actual images and as alpha masks. Even at the same time.

The images are scaled to fit the dimensions of the button - watch out for aspect ratio

In addition, you can use a background colour which can be modified with rounded corners and used to make round buttons.

The mouse cursor can be set for Hover and Down.

Everything can be configured in the IDE or during runtime.
